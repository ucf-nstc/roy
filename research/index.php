      <h4><strong>All-2D transistors and diodes</strong></h4>
      <p>We reported the first all-2D transistor with exfoliated MoS2 as the n-type channel, exfoliated h-BN and the gate dielectric, and CVD graphene as the source, drain and gate electrodes.</p>

      <h4><strong>Graphene-insulator-graphene (GIG) Resistive RAM</strong></h4>
      <p>We demonstrated forming-free switching in graphene/insulator/graphene resistive memories with sub-µA operating current, sub-nW reset power, ON/OFF ratio of ∼104, stable dc endurance for more than 200 dc cycles, and stable retention up to 104 s. The switching is highly nonlinear with rectifying characteristics in the sub-µA regime.The rectifying characteristic offers potential to reduce sneak-currents in cross-bar architectures.</p>

      <h4><strong>Graphene - h-BN - graphene SymFETs</strong></h4>
      <p>We fabricated a Symmetric FET (SymFET) with graphene/h-BN/graphene stack. Gate-controlled tunneling is observed. Temperature independence of tunneling current confirms direct tunneling across h-BN barrier. </p>

      <h4><strong><em>Radiation Effects and Reliability of GaN/AlGaN High Electron Mobility Transistors</em></strong><br/><br />
      <strong>Electrical stress induced pinch-off voltage shifts </strong></h4>
      <p>We observed that hot electron stress on GaN/AlGaN HEMTs causes positive shift in Vpinch-off for GaN grown in Ga-rich and N-rich conditions by MBE, while it causes a negative shift in Vpinch-off for GaN grown in NH3-rich conditions  by MBE and by MOCVD. MOCVD is itself an NH3-rich process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that dehydrogenation of hydrogenated Ga-vacancies by energetic hot electrons causes the positive Vpinch-off shift, while dehydrogenation of hydrogenated N-antisites causes the negative Vpinch-off shift.</p>

      <h4><strong>Effect of electrical stress on low frequency 1/f noise</strong></h4>
      <p>What about 1/f noise in GaN HEMTs? After stress, some devices show an increase in noise while some devices surprisingly show a decrease in 1/f noise. DFT again shows that hydrogenated C in N-site gets dehydrogenated by hot electrons. The dehydrogenated C in N-site has a defect energy level far away from the Fermi level in the channel. Thus, this defect no longer contributes to noise after stress, thereby reducing the noise. N-antisite is again the culprit from increased noise after stress in some devices.</p>

      <h4><strong>Temperature dependence and microscopic origin of 1/f noise</strong></h4>
      <p>Temperature dependent 1/f noise spectroscopy is a beautiful tool to inform us about the nature of defects present in a system. We observe that Ga-rich, N-rich and NH3-rich devices all show a peak in 1/f noise spectra at 0.2 eV. However, N-rich devices show an additional peak at > 1 eV. Again DFT comes to the rescue and tells us that the peak at 0.2 eV is due to the reconfiguration of a O atom in N site, which is a metastable defect. The >1 eV peak is due to transition between negative and neutral state of a N antisite.</p>

      <h4><strong>1.8-MeV proton irradiation effects</strong></h4>
      <p>Now, what about radiation effects in GaN HEMTs? We proved that GaN is extremely radiation-tolerant. As a result, GaN is great for use in space and other radiation-prone environments. We observed very low positive shifts in Vpinch-off for all growth conditions of GaN HEMTs. </p>
